# Episode List

#### Arc 1 - Misfit Hunters Arc

| Episode                         | Summary |
| ------------------------------- | ------- |
| [[E01 - Orientation Day]]       | Pistos’s chosen crew of bounty hunters are properly introduced to each other before being sent on a job to prove their ability. After wandering in the dark of the Shadowfell they eventually find their target: a wizard by the name of Brenshaw Lawheim.        |
| [[E02 - Lost in the Dark]]      |A trio of displacer beasts ambush the party. The party deals with them before making their way back to the ship with Brenshaw in tow. Along the way, they draw the attentions of a hoard of shades, and Gallow is killed before they are able to escape.         |
| [[E03 - The Night Spider]]      | Homeward bound from the Shadowfell, the party decides to take a detour and attempt to collect the bounty of one Captain Yeshk. After a drawn out battle, they are able to abscond with both Yeshk and his helmsman, but not without a few more of his crew jumping aboard.        |
| [[E04 - Job's Done]]            |  The crew subdue Yeshk’s crewmates and convince him to stand down. They return to the ABCD to collect his bounty, and Pistos informs them of their next steps.       |
| [[E05 - A Moment to Breathe]]   |Despite the colossal nature of their target, the job itself takes time to prepare for. The crew arms itself before Melodius’s “drunken” shenanigans force the crew to flee and pass time by hunting down the beholder known as Beels.         |
| [[E06 - Shortsighted]]          | The party, with a little unexpected help, are able to defeat Beels. As they return to the ABCD, they befriend respected bounty hunter Captain Flub. Unfortunately, when forced to hide some uncomfortable truths, they find his friendship short-lived and themselves placed in jail.        |
| [[E07 - Out of the Frying Pan]] | Jailed by the ABCD, the crew’s upcoming job turns from an opportunity into a requirement. Upon taking the job, they are faced with three paths to its resolution, each proposed by someone with a different idea on how to deal with a once-in-a-lifetime alpha tarrasque.        |
| [[E08 - Into the Fire]]         |The crew launches themselves into the mouth of the tarrasque they’ve been tasked with hunting in order to find the weapon that will help them seal the beast away.         |
| [[E09 - Belly of the Beast]]    | The crew battles their way through the tarrasque and eventually manage to find the Weapon that, hopefully, will allow them to complete their task and hunt the tarrasque.        |
| [[E10 - Titanfall]]             | The crew complete their hunt, and while they find themselves without the Weapon, they find themselves a pair of new allies in the form of the mage, Lucian, and his partner, Sephirus. Amethyst calls a group meeting and asks that everyone decide their plans moving forward, semi-officially cementing the crew as a crew and revealing their pasts in the process.        |
