## Synopsis

With the tarrasque approaching, the crew quickly sets about enacting their plan. As a squad of magically-aided dinosaurs and their wizard mounts fight hard to distract the tarrasque, Mordenkainen take the first opportunity to catapult the crew into the mouth of the beast, where they set about seeking out the weapon described to them by Mordenkainen. Within, they travel through its body, finding its interior to be just as dangerous as the exterior. After a battle with an unexpected mimic, the crew encounters a group of slime creatures that, after a brief skirmish, Melodius is able to exert some control over.
