## Synopsis

After abducting both Captain Yeshk and **Meep**, the young hadozee that acted as his helmsman, the party have a brief skirmish with the members of Yeshk's crew that had boarded the Flying Fish in an attempt to aid their captain. During the fight, the Flying Fish is boarded by a third party, a bounty hunter named **Pistachio** that held a grudge against the party for supposedly stealing both his lantern and his bounty. Pistachio is driven away, and Yeshk and his crew surrender, are subdued, restrained, and taken prisoner as Ladion tends to Melodius and MÃ¡ximon, who were both knocked unconscious during the battle.

Ari'ka, meanwhile, interrogates Meep, who's taken something of a liking to Krug. Amethyst offers Meep a position as the crew's helmsman, at least until he decides that he wants to do something else. Ari'ka also speaks with Brenshaw, curious if he had some sort of history with Pistachio, as well as about his past in general, eventually coming to the conclusion that she doesn't necessarily mistrust him nor is she actually sure that she wants to return him to the Stardeep. 

When the party returns to the ABCD, they find it full of Stardeep guards awaiting the party's return so that they can take Brenshaw back into custody. A squad of giff approach the party and Ari'ka and Krug both briefly move to prevent them from taking Brenshaw, but Brenshaw goes with them of his own will, but not without first privately leaving some parting words with Krug. Ari'ka telepathically attempts to ask the Stardeep squad's leader what Brenshaw actually did, but receives nothing but silence in response.

With Brenshaw back in custody, the party turns in Yeshk's bounty to Annie and receive, along with their payment, an additional reward in the form of several enchanted weapons and an envelope to be delivered to Pistos. Annie also informs the party that they have access to the ABCD's shipwright if they decide they require their services. The party return to Pistos, who offers to arrange transport for Gallow's body so that he may be laid to rest in his and Krug's home sphere.

She then goes on to debrief with each member of the party individually before telling them all what the original job was that they were gathered for: a contract taken out on a tarrasque. She offers each of the party a healthy sum of gold and promises of both fulfilling personal agreements and offering a bit of aid in the dangerous contract to come.
