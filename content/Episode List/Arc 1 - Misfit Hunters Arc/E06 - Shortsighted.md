## Synopsis

As the damaged beholder vessel falls planetside, the party pulls up alongside the damaged bounty hunter ship. The crew on board, visibly made up of a variety of bounty hunters rather than an official outfit, try to flag the party down and explain that the ship was damaged during a battle with the beholder. Melodius and Ari briefly argue over whether or not to aid them and quickly settle on focusing attention on the bounty. 

The beholder ship, damaged and apparently unable to fly, still presents a danger due to its functional eyestalks. After an ineffective attempt to distract the eyes using the various shoes Melodius had accidentally stolen, Máximon and Amethyst sneak ahead and find a safe way into the ship. They guide the party along the same path, and while Krug attracts attention at the last moment, they're able to get inside. After some exploration, the party comes across a spectator with impeccably done makeup and nails complaining about the actions of her captain. Melodius, Máximon and Krug convince the spectator, **Colleen**, that they're ship repairmen who "deal with problems" on the side, persuading her to help the party as they take on Beels.

Guided by Colleen, the party navigates the interior of the beholder vessel and, after dealing with security forces headed by an ogre, they come across Beels himself. After a brief but hard fought battle, during which was very nearly killed outright by Beels before being saved by Ari'ka, Beels was brought down and proof of his death collected.

On the return to the ABCD, the party offer to tow the damaged bounty ship back to safety. The captain of the ship, a well-respected flumph by the name of **Flub**, offered everyone a gold reward and his eternal friendship. Unfortunately, as the party returned to the ABCD they were swarmed by a mob of hunters angry about what Melodius had done. When none of the party chose to be straightforward about what had happened, Flub revoked his friendship and allowed the mob to take the party, who are thrown into jail.
