## Synopsis

After calming the slime creatures within the tarrasque, Melodius is absorbed into the tarrasque's body. Unable to do anything about it, the rest of the crew begins to make their way to the rear end of the tarrasque in order to fulfill their deal with the emperor. Along the way, Ari'ka is able to detect the weapon that the crew is tracking and leads them toward it.

They find the weapon inside of the tarrasque's stomach, where they quickly discover that it is lodged inside of the mouth of a purple worm. The crew tries to pry the weapon free, but is unable to do so before the worm flees elsewhere in the tarrasque. Following the worm, the crew catches a glimpse of Melodius in a distant and inaccessible chamber, dancing with more of the slime creatures that had swarmed the crew previously. They also come across various magical items that the tarrasque had previously ingested, including a bag of holding and a magical golden axe. 

Further toward the tail, the crew is stopped by a group of elementals formed from the tarrasque's waste. Unwilling to spend the time to fight them, everyone flees passed them and into the tarrasque's colon. There, they once again find the purple worm, who they quickly kill. 13 pulls the weapon from its corpse: a golden scepter, one that quickly transforms into a golden spear and speaks inside of 13's mind, addressing him as Master.
