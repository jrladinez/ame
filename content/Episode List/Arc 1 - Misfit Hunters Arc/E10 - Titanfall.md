## Synopsis

Almost as soon as 13 has taken up the Weapon, Morana is driven by her demon to try and steal it, though unsuccessful. 13 questions the spear, or the being within, who is unable to explain its origin but does agree to help 13 as 13 is the Weapon's new master. Even with 13's consent, however, neither Amethyst nor Krug are able to touch the Weapon, who doesn't deem them worthy. 

Melodius reemerges from the tarrasque's body, apparently managing to have maintained some amount of control over the other slime creatures, who he is able to command to ferry the crew through the body of the tarrasque to the creature's rectum. There, after battling more of the waste elementals, the crew is able to prep the tail with 13's explosive spears before the slimes ferry them back up to the heart. At the heart of the tarrasque, 13 plunges the spear in. There, the Weapon gives 13 the choice of what to do, and he chooses to seal the tarrasque as Mordenkainen had requested. In the process, the spear appears to become a mundane spear. With Mordenkainen's spell about to cast, the crew flees the tarrasque's body and, with the timely aid of Meep, are able to return to Mordenkainen safely.

At Mordenkainen's camp, a wizard takes the Weapon from 13 from study before the crew is able to meet with Mordenkainen, who offers his friendship in the form of a future favor, as well as offering Ari'ka a star chart leading to a magic item purveyor. He also reveals that the mage who had taken the Weapon was not part of his circle. Additionally, he finds a seal within 13's mind, one that locks away his memories using very powerful magic. He gives the crew a sending stone to reach him in future and the crew takes their leave to speak with the emperor, who rewards the crew with half of the promised 25 thousand gold pieces he'd promised them, with the promise that he would pay the remainder later on, as well as allow the crew to take the surplus of tarrasque materials.

Before returning home, the crew speak to **Lucian** about recruiting him and his partner, the sword-wielding spinosaurus, **Sephirus**. Lucian explains that Sephirus is heavily wounded to the point that even magic seemed to have no effect. Through a process similar to resurrection, the crew is able to restore Sephirus, and in response Lucian pledges himself and his services to the crew. During the restoration, however, Ari'ka accidentally reveals her true form: her wings spread outward, and what appear to be fiery blue forms sprout from her head. 

Back on the ship, Amethyst calls all of the crew together to question them about their plans moving forward. Everyone agrees that, for one reason or another, they do intend to stay with the crew, though in the process, it's revealed that Ladion and Ari'ka have an existing, long lasting connection; Ladion had once been, effectively, Ari'ka's jailer. 13 also informs the crew that he has memories of a former life, while Krug explains that he's overcome with grief at the death of everyone close to him.

With the meeting concluded, the crew arrives at the ABCD.
